- The endpoint requires authentication via a JWT token.
- The `userID` is extracted from the JWT token to associate the post with the authenticated user.
- A new JWT token is returned with each successful response for token refresh purposes.
- The `question` field must be non-empty; otherwise, a `400 Bad Request` error will be returned.
