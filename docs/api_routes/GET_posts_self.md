## Notes
- The endpoint requires authentication via JWT token
- The user is identified from the JWT token in the Authorization header
- Unlike `/posts/user/:id`, this endpoint doesn't require a user ID parameter as it uses the authenticated user's ID
- Each post includes:
  - `_id`: The unique identifier of the post
  - `question`: The question text
  - `answer`: The answer text
  - `user_id`: The ID of the user who created the post
  - `username`: The username of the user who created the post
  - `comments`: An array of comments on the post, each with:
    - `userID`: The ID of the user who made the comment
    - `username`: The username of the user who made the comment
    - `contents`: The content of the comment
  - `numOfLikes`: The number of likes the post has received
- A new JWT token is returned with each successful response for token refresh purposes
